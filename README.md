# DeepJDOT: Deep Joint Distribution Optimal Transport for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Accepted for publication in ECCV 2018.
#
Codes are implemented in keras with tensorflow backend.
DeepJDOT code relies on the optimal transport tool box "POT:Python Optimal Transport library". Please see this [link](https://github.com/rflamary/POT) for the instructions to install POT.
