# DeepJDOT
This repository contains the codes of the following paper

BB Damodaran, B Kellenberger, R Flamary, D Tuia, N Courty, "[DeepJDOT:Deep Joint Distribution Optimal Transport for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10081)", in European Conference on Computer Vision 2018 (ECCV-2018).
#
Codes are implemented in keras with tensorflow backend.
DeepJDOT code relies on the optimal transport tool box "POT:Python Optimal Transport library". Please see this [link](https://github.com/rflamary/POT) for the instructions to install POT.
