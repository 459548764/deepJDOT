# DeepJDOT
This repository contains the codes of the following paper

BB Damodaran, B Kellenberger, R Flamary, D Tuia, N Courty, "[DeepJDOT:Deep Joint Distribution Optimal Transport for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10081)", in European Conference on Computer Vision 2018 (ECCV-2018).
# Dependencies
In order to run, the code requires the following Python modules:
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * [POT](https://github.com/rflamary/POT) (Python Optimal Transport library)
  * keras with tensorflow backend
# Modules
* Deepjdot - module contains the implementation of the DeepJDOT
* dnn      - import necessary functions from keras
* deepjdot_demo  - DeepJDOT on the sample dataset

To run the DeepJDOT on the sample dataset, Please see or run the "deepjdot_demo.py"
